# Agent guidelines

Instructions for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, opencode, Cursor, …) working
in this repository.

## Attribution — never attribute AI in the repo

- **Never** add AI/assistant attribution to commits or pull requests: no
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any other assistant) trailer, and no
  "🤖 Generated with …" line. Author every commit solely as the repository owner.
- AI assistance is disclosed **once**, in the README's "AI disclosure" section —
  that is the only place it belongs. Keep it out of the commit history entirely.

## Releases & versioning — auto-incremented from commit type

CI cuts a release on every push to `main`, and the version is **derived
automatically from the commit history** (Conventional Commits) — nobody bumps a
version by hand, so a forgotten manual release still versions correctly. The
commit **subject prefix** decides the bump:

- `feat: …` — a new feature → **minor** bump (1.2.0 → 1.3.0)
- `fix: …` — a bug fix / hotfix → **patch** bump (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
- `feat!: …` (or any `type!:`, e.g. `fix!:`), or a `BREAKING CHANGE` — a breaking
  change → **major** bump (1.4.2 → 2.0.0)
- anything else (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, …) or an un-prefixed subject →
  **patch** bump

So **pick the right commit-subject prefix for the change** and the release version
follows automatically. Never hand-edit `version` in `Cargo.toml` to release — CI
computes and stamps it.
